# DHSAlumni-Analytics

Pulling historical data for my private ESPN fantasy football league.

This league has been active since 2012. My goal is to analyze historical wins, losses, points scored to evaluate which owners have been the best and worst since our league's inception.

In future updates, my goals are to create player projections for our league, evaluate which teams have been the lucky/unlucky over the years, and evaluate which owners are the best at getting value in the draft and free agency. 

Eventually, I want to serve this data in a Flask web app and create a site that myself and my league mates can access anytime.
